# BootsOfSpeed

`Boots of Speed` refers to an Item Card in the popular legacy style board game [Gloomhaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven). The item allows the user to adjust their initiative.

Keeping track of initiative in Gloomhaven is tricky and error prone. BootsOfSpeed aims to reduce the difficulty of tracking initiative while playing Gloomhaven by providing a shared space for players to simultaneously track their initiatives.
